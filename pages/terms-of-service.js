                <br/><br/>
                Please be aware that products offered by Dragon Organics contain substances recognized by the state of California as potentially causing cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive

              <h3 className="text-primary">Kratom Product Disclaimer and Safty Concerns</h3>
              <p>
                Products available from Dragon Organics may include Kratom. It is vital to note that pregnant and nursing women should refrain from consuming items that contain 
                Kratom. Additionally, individuals under the age of 21 should avoid products containing Kratom, and it is imperative to store such items out of reach of children. These products 
                are not designed to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
                <br/><br/>
                It is noteworthy that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classifies Kratom as a "Drug and Chemical of Concern."
                <br/><br/>
                The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not granted approval for Kratom as a dietary supplement or for any medical application. The FDA is actively assessing Kratom and 
                currently advises against its consumption due to apprehensions about the risks of addiction, abuse, and dependence. Certain individuals have reported experiencing severe withdrawal 
                symptoms resembling those associated with opioids upon discontinuation of Kratom use. For additional details, please refer to the FDA import alert 54-15.
                <br/><br/>
                Furthermore, public health authorities in both the U.S. and worldwide have indicated that short- or long-term use of Kratom may be linked to various adverse reactions, which 
                include, but are not limited to, nervousness, agitation, confusion, aggression, hallucinations, delusions, tremors, sleep disturbances, drowsiness, lethargy, sedation, skin 
                hyperpigmentation, reduced libido, constipation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, liver toxicity, tachycardia, hypertension, respiratory depression, respiratory 
                arrest, cardiac arrest, renal failure, seizures, coma, and even fatality. Should you experience any adverse reactions to this product, we strongly advise you to immediately 
                contact your healthcare provider or seek emergency medical assistance.
                <br/><br/>

                Under no circumstances shall Dragon Organics, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service providers, or licensors be liable for 
                any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, lost profits, lost revenue, lost 
                savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or similar damages. This applies whether the claim arises from contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal 
                theory, and whether or not advised of the possibility of such damages. Please note that some states or jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for 
                consequential or incidental damages, so in those states or jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

                Our failure to enforce any right or provision outlined in these Terms of Service does not mean we are waiving that right or provision.
                <br/><br/>
                These Terms of Service, along with any policies or operational guidelines posted on this site or related to the Service, represent the complete agreement between you and

                These Terms of Service, along with any separate agreements governing the provision of our Services, shall be interpreted and governed by the laws of the United States.
                <br/><br/>
                The parties mutually agree that any disputes arising from or related to this Agreement will be exclusively resolved in the District Court for the State of Georgia, situated 
                in Gwinnett County, Georgia, and the dispute will be governed by the laws of Georgia. Both parties consent to the service of legal notices in any such dispute if served in compliance 
                with the notice provisions specified herein.
                <br/><br/>

                cause of action arises.
                <br/><br/>
                The failure of Dragon Organics to enforce strict performance of any provision in these terms and conditions shall not be considered a waiver of that provision or right. Neither 
                the parties' course of conduct nor trade practices will modify any of these terms and conditions. Dragon Organics reserves the right to assign its rights and duties under this 
                Agreement to any party at any time without prior notice to you.
